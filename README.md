I am a highly motivated junior penetration tester with hands-on experience in assessing both internal and external systems. My expertise includes identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in network infrastructures, with a particular focus on Active Directory environments. I have a solid understanding of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and I am proficient in applying this knowledge to web application testing and securing critical assets. Additionally, I possess strong programming skills in C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL, which enhance my ability to create custom scripts, automate tasks, and perform thorough code reviews.
