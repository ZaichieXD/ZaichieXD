# 👋 Hi, I’m Charles Zolina

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building functional, scalable web applications using **Laravel**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
I also develop in **C#** with **Unity**, creating interactive systems and games that sharpen my design sense and problem-solving skills.  

Alongside development, I have a strong foundation in **cybersecurity and penetration testing**, helping me write more secure and resilient applications.  
My projects range from **inventory and sales prediction systems** to software integrating **machine learning** and **real-time security features**.

I focus on **clean, efficient, and maintainable code** — turning ideas into reliable, well-structured solutions that blend creativity, security, and practical use.
