Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who builds functional, scalable web applications using PHP (Laravel), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also work with C# and Unity, creating interactive systems and games that sharpen my problem-solving and design sense. Alongside development, I have a strong foundation in cybersecurity and penetration testing, which helps me write more secure, resilient applications. My projects range from inventory and sales prediction systems to software that integrates machine learning and real-time security features. I focus on writing clean, efficient code and enjoy turning ideas into reliable, well-structured software that blends creativity, security, and real-world use.
