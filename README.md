I’m a full-stack developer who builds practical web applications using Laravel, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Most of my experience comes from hands-on projects — everything from creating an inventory management system to integrating machine learning for sales forecasting. I also explore cybersecurity and Salesforce development, which helps me understand software from different angles. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and enjoy turning ideas into working systems that solve real problems.
